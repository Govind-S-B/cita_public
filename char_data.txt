Cita, the extroverted adventurer from the southern village of Freilun, is a whirlwind of energy and enthusiasm.  Marked by a near-death experience at sea, she's driven by a fear of stagnation and a desire to see the world before her time runs out.  This former seafarer turned grand wizard and thief,  balances her daring exploits with a surprisingly mundane hobby: bookkeeping.  Always accompanied by her loyal cat, the sole survivor of the accident alongside her, Cita faces the world with a smile, a quick wit, and a touch of chaos.
